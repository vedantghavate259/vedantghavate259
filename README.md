## PROJECTS
### How the War in Ukraine is Affecting the Predictability of the Energy Stock MarketHow the War in Ukraine is Affecting the Predictability of the Energy Stock Market Jan 2023 - May 2023
- In this study, we explore the impact of individual sentiment about the war on the energy stock market. We go through the process of collecting and preprocessing tweets to then implement them into some of the latest developments in topic modeling and sentiment analysis. This includes the financial analysis of the stock data and tying the results of the NLP process into price forecasting.
- On February 24, 2022, Russia Launched a full-scale military attack on Ukraine. Since the start of this war, there have been more than three thousand civilian casualties and millions of others displaced from their homes (Center for Preventive Action).
- Being one of the biggest conflicts in recent history, this war is unique in that the voice of the public is easily accessible through social media. This helps us get a closer look at all the major impacts the invasion has had from the perspective of individuals. This war has also had major impacts globally, especially in the energy market due to international sanctions, artificial scarcity, and loss in accessible export. Before the war, Russia was the number one exporter of energy to the global markets. They supplied about 40% of the European Union’s natural gas, a quarter of its oil, and over half its coal in 2019. 

### Analyzing the Impact of the Presence of Mental Wellbeing Facilities on Crime Rates Sep 2022 - Dec 2022

- Visualization project to find the disparity in the availability of mental well-being facilities.
- An identified pattern of increase in mental well-being facilities leads to an increase in the mindfulness of the people and results in lower hate crime.
- Identified states with a high occurrence of specific motivation for the hate crime.
